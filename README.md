# Udacity Google Map Project - Places of interest in Madrid

### Overview
A single page application featuring a map of a certain area, in this case Madrid, Spain. Regarding to its functionality it filters a list locations and the related markers, and collects third-party data about those locations and displays it in the google map infowindow of each marker.

### How to get started
To see the app in action:
- Download or clone the repo at  https://github.com/Salsatore89/google-maps-udacity-project
- Open the index.html file in your favourite browser.
- You need an internet connection because the app gets information from Google Maps & Wikipedia API's.

### App features
- Responsive.
- Automatically adjusts bounds and zooms of the map to display all markers.
- Notifies users if an error occurs.
- Menu opens and closes with the hamburger icon.
- Collects data using Google Maps APIs and Wikipedia APIs.
- The list of locations can be filtered using the search bar. Filtering the list also filters the related markers and changes it color.
- Clicking on a location in the list opens the infowindow of its marker with Wikipedia information.
- Cliking on a marker changes its icon (from red to blue).
- Clicking on the map closes the infowindow in case it is open.
